            Morty is awoken by his grandfather Rick in his drunken state. Rick takes Morty for a ride in his flying car and rambles on about how he made a neutrino bomb and plans to wipe out all life on Earth. Rick lands the vehicle on Morty's demand and passes out. Morty hears the bomb being activated, and the opening credits start rolling.

  Morty's family learns that he has missed a semester of school in the time he's spent on adventures with Rick. Rick takes Morty to another dimension, known as Dimension 35-C, which has the perfect conditions for growing "Mega Trees", which Rick requires for his research. In order to get past intergalactic customs, Morty hides the Mega Tree seeds in his rectum, but when their cover is blown, Rick and Morty escape while engaging in a shootout with bureaucratic alien insects. Ultimately, the seeds are used to briefly make Morty highly intelligent, causing his parents to believe he is fine with his education. This, however, wastes the seeds' energy, so Rick informs Morty that they need to go back and get more, while their aftereffects leave Morty writhing on the floor.
